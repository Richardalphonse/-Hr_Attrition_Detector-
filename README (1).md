# Attrition Detecter

A  Machine learning model to be deployed to retain the human cpaital of the firm.


## Introduction
Attrition is critical within the business nowadays. Itâ€™s the most problem which highlights altogether the organizations. knowing that the organization loses key skills and knowledge. managers and HR administrators are greatly fascinated by reducing turnover within the organization in such the way that it'll contribute to the utmost effectiveness, and progress of the organization because employees are the foremost treasured assets of a company.
